            <p> Technology has been growing so fast that any business that fails to utilize it will go extinct faster than anyone could expect.</p>
            <div><p> In this way, we would like to present to you the next breakthrough doors that will change the game like never before. Not only we are planning to increase security of our doors, we want to use technology to improve convenience and quality of life for our clients and users. </p></div>

            <p class = "title"> Facial Recognition Feature: </p>
            <div class = "border"><p> Through using Siamese neural networks as our design, we would like to implement a live system that enables the our clients to unlock (1st step) the door by simply showing their faces to the built-in camera on the doors. Our neural network is trained through using 400 training images which will be quite sufficient for training such an accurate model. Interstingly enough, face identification will not only be enough to open the door, and the users can open the door only if they pass the audio test as well</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class = "a-r-f">
            <p class = "title">Audio Recognition Feature:</p>
            <div class = "border"><p>Once user's face is recognized, they can proceed to unlock the door through voice activation. They can lock and unlock the door through the built-in commands that we have provided.</p></div>

            <p class = "title"> Our webservers:</p>
            <div class = "border"> <p> Through using modern CSS/JS, we have implemented visually-appealing web servers that will attract customers from all sorts of demographics. </div>

            <div class = "border"><p> We would always want to take good care ofour customers. In this way, we will go beyond imagination to ensure that they are having the experience that they deserve. In case that the power is cut and our systems cannot operate, we will have manual keys along with safe boxes that can be unlocked through passcode/smartphone scanning. </p></div>

        <div class = "iadesign">
            <p class = "title"> Wireframe of IA Design:</p>
            <div class = "border"><p>Firstly the users will be introduced to the homepage which will look fairly straight forward. We have already developed a basic login page that will hold
          credentials in a database. The reason for this is that each individual that uses our product will have their own "faces" that will be recognized.</p>
            <div class = "image-holder"><img alt = "The main page for our server" src = "images/login.png"></div>
            <p>Once logged in, we plan to have a simple interface with a few buttons similar to the Tello Drone controller.</p>
            <p>We will have an area for the camera feed (strictly for taking a photo and then displaying it, not a live feed) and buttons to add this photo to the list of recognized faces. Since this area will be empty in the beginning (no photo = no display) we plan to have simple instructions demonstrating how to set up accounts and users.</p>
            <p>There will be a text list of users that are associated with the account, basically people who are able to operate the door. Adding new users will have 2 steps : taking the picture such that it satisifies the user, and adding the picture to the database. Editing users will redirect users to a new page in which they can choose which entries to delete or change the names. Changing the photo associated with that name may be a possible implementation.</p>
            <p>Whenever users want to operate the door or simply test it, they can click scan face which will run the proper procedures to compare the current face in front of the webcam to the pictures stored in the database.</p>
            <p>Here is a basic layout that will most likely be changed in the future</p>
            <div class = "image-holder"><img alt = "The page where we capture images and store in database" src = "images/app_ex.png"></div>
            <p>Once logged in users will have the option to log out (will be added later). There is only currently 2 routes for users to directly access, which is the login page and the actual app interface, which is called index.html.</p>
            <p>Using simple buttons seemed like the most logical choice since every option we have on our interface is simply yes or no, so there was not much need for special checkboxes or radio buttons.</p>
